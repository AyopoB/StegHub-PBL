**Storage Technologies Overview**

- **NAS (Network-attached storage)**: Centralized file storage that allows multiple clients to access files over a network, commonly used for file-level storage.
- **SAN (Storage Area Network)**: High-performance network providing block-level storage, typically used in enterprise environments for mission-critical applications.
  
**Protocols**:
- **NFS (Network File System)**: Used for distributed file systems, allowing files to be accessed over a network as if they were local.
- **(s)FTP (File Transfer Protocol / Secure)**: Protocols for transferring files over a network, with sFTP adding encryption for security.
- **SMB (Server Message Block)**: Protocol for sharing files, printers, and other resources between computers on a network.
- **iSCSI (Internet Small Computer Systems Interface)**: Protocol for accessing block storage over IP networks, often used in SAN environments.

**Block-Level Storage vs. Object Storage**:
- **Block Storage**: Data is stored in fixed-sized blocks, often used for databases or raw storage in cloud environments like AWS's Elastic Block Store (EBS). It provides low latency and high performance.
- **Object Storage**: Stores data as objects with metadata, best for unstructured data like media files, and used in services like AWS's S3.
  
**AWS Examples**:
- **Block Storage (EBS)**: Used for EC2 instances, providing persistent and low-latency storage for block data.
- **Object Storage (S3)**: Ideal for storing large amounts of unstructured data with access via HTTP protocols.
- **Network File System (EFS)**: AWS's NFS-compatible service for scalable file storage that multiple EC2 instances can access concurrently.

Understanding these distinctions helps in choosing the right storage solutions for different cloud workloads and architectures.
