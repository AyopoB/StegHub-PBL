# AWS Cloud Project Documentation: Hosting Two Company Websites Using Reverse Proxy Technology

You will design and implement a secure AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) infrastructure for a fictional company, Ayops. This infrastructure will host Ayops's primary business website, powered by the WordPress Content Management System (CMS), and a Tooling Website (PHP/MySQL) tailored for their DevOps team. To improve security and optimize performance, the solution will incorporate NGINX as a reverse proxy. The project emphasizes cost-effectiveness, robust security, and scalability. The objective is to create an architecture that ensures high availability for both the WordPress and Tooling websites, can seamlessly handle traffic surges, and minimizes operational costs.

3. **Create an AMI** for both WordPress and Tooling EC2 instances:  
   - Navigate to **Actions** > **Image and Templates** > **Create Image**.  
   - Provide a name for the AMI (e.g., `WordPress-AMI` and `Tooling-AMI`).

#### **2. Prepare Launch Templates for Web Servers (One per Subnet)**  
Launch templates simplify instance configuration. You will create one launch template per subnet for both WordPress and Tooling.

1. In the **EC2 Dashboard**, go to **Launch Templates**.  
2. Click **Create Launch Template** and configure the settings:  
   - **Template Name**: Example - `WordPress-Launch-Template`.  
   - **AMI ID**: Choose the respective AMI for WordPress or Tooling.  
   - **Instance Type**: Choose `t2.micro` or the appropriate instance size.  
   - **Subnet**: Choose the appropriate public subnet.  
3. Under **Advanced Details**, configure **UserData** for WordPress:  

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y wordpress
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
```

4. Click **Create Launch Template**.  
5. Repeat for the Tooling instances, adjusting the software to fit the needs of your Tooling website.

### **Configure Application Load Balancer (ALB)**



#### **Application Load Balancer to Route Traffic to Web Servers**

This internal ALB will route traffic from Nginx to WordPress and Tooling web servers.

1. **Create an Internal ALB**:
   - Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard** > **Load Balancers** > **Create Load Balancer** > **Application Load Balancer**.
   - Select **Internal** as the scheme.
   - **Listeners**:
     - Add a listener for HTTPS (Port 443).
   - **VPC and Subnets**:
     - Select the appropriate VPC.
     - Choose private subnets in each Availability Zone.

2. **Configure SSL/TLS Certificates**:
   - Use the wildcard certificate from ACM for your domain.

3. **Set Security Groups**:
   - Create a security group that allows HTTPS traffic only from the Nginx instances.

4. **Create Target Groups for Web Servers**:
   - Create a separate target group for WordPress and Tooling instances:
     - **Instances** as the target type.
     - Protocol: TCP.
     - Port: 80.
   - Register WordPress and Tooling instances in their respective target groups.

5. **Health Check**:
   - Ensure the health check passes for each target group.

5. **Mount EFS on EC2 Instances**:
   - SSH into each Nginx and Web Server instance.
   - Use the following commands to mount the EFS:

```bash
sudo yum install -y amazon-efs-utils
sudo mkdir /mnt/efs
sudo mount -t efs -o tls fs-<filesystem-id>:/ /mnt/efs
```

### **Set Up RDS (Relational Database Service)**

1. **Create a KMS Key**:
   - Navigate to **KMS Dashboard** > **Create Key** > **Symmetric Key**.
   - Use this key to encrypt the RDS instance.

2. **Create a Subnet Group**:
   - Navigate to **RDS Dashboard** > **Subnet Groups**.
   - Add private subnets for the data layer to the group.

3. **Create an RDS Instance**:
   - Navigate to **RDS Dashboard** > **Create Database**.
   - Choose **MySQL 8.x**.
   - Use the **Dev/Test Template** for cost savings.
   - For **Multi-AZ Deployment**:
     - Select "Do not create a standby instance" if you are testing.
   - Allocate storage appropriately.
   - Use the KMS key for encryption.
   - Ensure the database is deployed in the private subnets.
   - Disable public access.

4. **Configure Backup and Monitoring**:
   - Enable automated backups and set retention.
   - Export logs to CloudWatch for analysis.

### **Configuring DNS with Route53**

1. **Create Alias Records**:
   - Navigate to **Route53 Dashboard** > **Hosted Zones**.
   - For the **root domain (e.g., newdevops.ip-ddns.com)**:
     - Create an **Alias Record** pointing to the DNS name of the Internet-facing ALB.
   - For the **Tooling subdomain (e.g., tooling.newdevops.ip-ddns.com)**:
     - Create an **Alias Record** pointing to the DNS name of the internal ALB.

2. **Validate DNS Records**:
   - Use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to verify that the records are resolving correctly.
   - Open a browser to confirm that the websites are accessible at their respective URLs.
